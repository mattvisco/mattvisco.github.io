<div class='work-single__text-holder'>
<p>One day I was sitting in Prospect Park in New York with my sketch book and started drawing a creature of sorts. This creature was made out of squiggles. I have always been fascinated by squiggles for some reason, this fascination is probably what inspired the drawing.</p>
<p>After completing the drawing I was staring at it and thought what if I could become this creature. The Gornman is a fictional character that friends and I conjured years ago and perhaps I had just drawn this fictional character. The next step was to become him.</p>
<p>Becoming the Gornman is an openFrameworks application. The underlying physics behind the application is a hair simulation. The squiggles are drawn around the hair and follow the same motion as the underlying hair.</p>
<p class='no-pad'> To try to become the gornman yourself <a href="http://faavi.weebly.com/" target="_blank">click here.</a> Unfortunately this project was poorly commented and the code is a bit messy, I apologize.</p>

  <p>In response to the Covid-19 pandemic, a team of the roboticist from the University of Southern Denmark developed a fully automatic throat swab robot. </p>
  <p>I was hired as a contracter via the <i>Copenhagen Institute of Interaction</i> to lead the design efforts of an end-to-end experience. This project was particularly challenging because the interaction required a person to allow a robot to swab the back of their throat, which most participants were not comfortable with. Much of our design efforts was focused on helping make the patient comfortable with this disorienting relationship with a machine.</p>
  <p>In parallel to designing the core interactions of their swabbing robot, we explored other alternatives such as a vending machine for self tests.</p>
